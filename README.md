**AI Model Evaluation and Comparison**
**Description**
This project demonstrates how to evaluate and compare different AI models to determine the best performer for a specific task. The goal is to provide a comprehensive approach for model evaluation, including the use of various performance metrics, cross-validation techniques, and visualization tools. This project is designed to help developers and data scientists easily compare multiple machine learning models to select the most efficient one for their use case.

**Features**
1. Model Evaluation: Implements various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, confusion matrix, and ROC curve.
2. Model Comparison: Allows for the comparison of different machine learning models on the same dataset.
3. Visualization: Utilizes graphs and plots to visualize the performance of different models.
4. Cross-Validation: Includes support for k-fold cross-validation to assess the generalization ability of the models.
5. Reporting: Provides a detailed summary of model performances.
